# Implemented Features: Air-gapped Data Utility (ADU)

## 1. Project Setup and Scaffolding
*   Initial directory structure created (`adu/static`, `adu/templates`, `adu/data`).
*   Core files created (`adu/app.py`, `adu/requirements.txt`, `adu/Dockerfile`, `adu/worker.py`, `adu/database.py`).

## 2. Database Management
*   SQLite database (`/tmp/adu.db`) for job history and error logging.
*   `jobs` table schema defined (`job_id`, `db_username`, `overall_status`, `start_time`, `end_time`).
*   `errors` table schema defined (`id`, `job_id`, `timestamp`, `error_message`, `traceback`, `context`).
*   `job_configs` table schema defined (`job_id`, `config` (JSON string)).
*   Dedicated `init_database.py` script for one-time database initialization, ensuring a clean start and resolving multi-process locking issues.
*   Centralized database connection management via `adu/database.py`.

## 3. Backend (Flask Application)
*   Basic Flask application setup (`adu/app.py`).
*   API endpoints implemented:
    *   `/api/history`: Returns a JSON list of all completed job records.
    *   `/api/job/<job_id>`: Returns a JSON object with detailed record of a single job.
    *   `/api/job/<job_id>/errors`: Returns a JSON list of all errors for a specified job.
    *   `/api/jobs` (POST): Endpoint to create new jobs, accepting full configuration.
*   **Security Integration:**
    *   `Flask-SeaSurf` integrated for CSRF protection.
    *   `Flask-Talisman` integrated for setting security headers.
    *   `SECRET_KEY` configured for session management.
*   **Secure Credential Handling:**
    *   Password encryption using `cryptography.fernet` before storing in `job_configs` table.
    *   Job configuration (including encrypted credentials) stored in `job_configs` table, linked to `jobs` table.

## 4. Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)
*   Enhanced HTML templates:
    *   `index.html`: Main dashboard with comprehensive form to start new jobs, including output path configuration and optional table selection.
    *   `history.html`: Displays a list of all past jobs.
    *   `job_details.html`: Displays details for a single job, including errors.
*   **Enhanced Job Configuration Form:** Updated to support new configuration options including:
    *   Output path specification (defaults to `/tmp/exports`)
    *   Optional table selection (leave empty for auto-discovery of all tables)
    *   Proper handling of comma-separated table lists converted to arrays
*   JavaScript for fetching and displaying data from API endpoints on `history.html` and `job_details.html`.
*   JavaScript for submitting new job configurations via the form on `index.html`.

## 5. Data Processing Worker
*   `adu/worker.py` implemented as a background process with full data processing capabilities.
*   Worker polls the `jobs` table for `queued` jobs.
*   Retrieves full job configuration from `job_configs` table.
*   Decrypts database password using the `FERNET_KEY` environment variable.
*   **Actual Database Connections:** Implemented support for PostgreSQL and Vertica databases using `psycopg2` and `vertica-python`.
*   **Schema Discovery:** Automatic table discovery when no specific tables are provided in configuration.
*   **Data Export:** Uses Polars to read database tables and export to Parquet format.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Processes multiple tables sequentially with individual error handling per table.
*   **Structured Logging:** Comprehensive logging system with file and console output.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error capture with `error_message`, `traceback`, and `context` for failed operations.
*   **Job Status Management:** Updates `jobs` table with `complete` or `complete_with_errors` status based on results.
*   **Per-table Error Tracking:** Logs individual table failures to the `errors` table while continuing with remaining tables.

## 6. Enhanced User Interface (UI/UX)
*   **Comprehensive Job Details Page:** Fully implemented with:
    *   Complete job configuration display (with sensitive data redacted)
    *   Real-time export summary statistics (total/completed/failed/processing tables)
    *   Individual table export status with progress tracking
    *   Row counts and file paths for completed exports
    *   Direct links to view logs filtered by job ID
*   **Real-time Dashboard:** Enhanced history page with:
    *   Auto-refreshing job status every 5 seconds
    *   Visual progress bars showing table export completion
    *   Color-coded status indicators
    *   Toggle-able auto-refresh functionality
*   **Log Viewer Interface:** Dedicated logs page with:
    *   Real-time log streaming with auto-refresh
    *   Job-specific log filtering
    *   Configurable line limits (50-1000 lines)
    *   Syntax highlighting for different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## 7. Data Validation and Quality Assurance
*   **Pandera Integration:** Comprehensive data validation using Pandera:
    *   Automatic schema generation from DataFrame structure
    *   Data type validation for all exported tables
    *   Null value handling and validation
    *   Validation warnings logged but don't prevent export
    *   Per-table validation reporting in logs

## 8. Advanced Security and Logging
*   **Sensitive Data Redaction:** Comprehensive logging security:
    *   Automatic redaction of passwords, API keys, and credentials in logs
    *   Pattern-based detection of sensitive information
    *   Encrypted password value redaction
    *   Connection string sanitization
    *   Custom logging filters to prevent data leaks
*   **Structured Logging:** Enhanced logging system:
    *   File and console output with consistent formatting
    *   Log level filtering and configuration
    *   Job-specific log context and correlation
    *   Worker activity tracking and performance metrics

## 9. Testing Framework
*   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage:
    *   Worker functionality tests (data validation, sensitive data redaction)
    *   Database operations and schema tests
    *   API endpoint integration tests
*   **Test Infrastructure:**
    *   Modular test runner with selective execution
    *   Temporary database isolation for tests
    *   Mock-based testing for external dependencies
    *   Automated test execution with success/failure reporting

## 10. Production Deployment
*   **Environment Configuration:** Production-ready configuration management:
    *   Environment variable-based configuration
    *   Secure secret key and encryption key management
    *   Configurable database paths and logging locations
    *   Development vs. production environment detection

## 11. Containerization (Docker)
*   **Development Container:**
    *   Basic `Dockerfile` for development and testing
    *   Uses `python:3.10-slim` as base image
    *   Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
